com.ioanalazar.bdays,Anirudh Sharma,"I'd like to start using the app, but I'm stuck at the part where it needs permission to create alarms. I've checked high and low but can't find the ability to grant such a permission to apps! Please include basic setup instructions on the Play Store page so that people can troubleshoot such issues to avoid weird inconveniences right off the bat.",3
com.ioanalazar.bdays,SimbiAni Love,"June2023: Lovely app! but NEEDS: options for social links, email/address, etc; ""gift ideas"" shd just be called ""notes""; ability to customize ALL colors, including the ""person type"" tags; editing date mode shd be [YEAR-MM-DD] 🙏 UPDATE! Oct2025: Still no Google login (want to use ~diff accts for diff reasons), so no multi-device access either; still no tag color editing; still no proper sorting (by age OR calendar); also please, hide those delete buttons! shd be safely ~inside bday profiles; thx!",2
com.ioanalazar.bdays,Jeff Boswell,Great way to remember birthdays. love the day before notice that it gives you!!!,5
com.ioanalazar.bdays,Kirsty M,"4.75 stars. This is a fabulous app with almost every feature I want, and some I didn't even know I wanted! If you could add 'sort/order by age' (eg youngest to oldest) then I would revise to 5 stars, it's the only feature I want that is missing.",4
com.ioanalazar.bdays,Lucas Fatoux Kremser,"The app never sends me a notification when there's a birthday, which is the whole point of the app. I have the latest version and all of my settings are correct, but it never works.

com.ioanalazar.bdays,MUGILAN A,"It had one job and it failed miserably in that. The notification system is trash here, so don't expect this app to correctly notify you on specific days. I had my notification come 10 days after my frnds birthday. Other than the notification system, the record keeping is fine. No issues over there. Edit: after the update, the notification system is working. Thanking the developers for the update.",5

com.ioanalazar.bdays,John Boy,Pop up spam ad came up within 1 minutes of using app for first time... It said my phone needed to upgrade it's security software. No way to close the ad. Just kept making noise and trying to force me to spam website. Had to reboot phone and uninstall app.,1
com.ioanalazar.bdays,christine,"I love it so much, thank you and literally can set up a reminder beforehand?? woaahh and I can add on two reminders. This app is dope as heckkk. Recommended 10/10. Matter of fact, out of the charts.",5
com.ioanalazar.bdays,Elowen Masters-Bogard,"The app's almost perfect, the problem is it'll fix people who have their birthdays on 2/29 (29/2) to 3/1 (1/3) even during a leap year. It's a little annoying, and while I get why it changes, I wish it changed to the latter date only during non-leap years rather than immediately adjusting it.",4
