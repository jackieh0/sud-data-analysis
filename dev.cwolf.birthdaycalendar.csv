dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I am using this app on a Samsung SM-X700 (Galaxy Tab S8) tablet. Each time I insert a new entry the year (at the top of the screen) jumps to a randomly different year giving a wrong age to the individual.

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,It's simple and easy to use. Sounds cliche but that's all it is. It has the calendar and you can put the person's name/year/day. You can also put multiple different birthdays on the same day. I got 3 people on the same day and you can open it up pretty simple. You can also scroll into the past/future years. I don't use it much but when I do it's a quick open-close.,5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Did not remind me of a birthday I set?,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Great app... Only one tiny issue is that I can't have two different timings for reminders. For example, I want to get a reminder on the previous day say at 10 pm and then again the next morning (the day of the ""birthday"") at 8 am... But I get to set only one timimg for both the days.",4

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,This app allows me to relax & know that I'm not missing the birthdays of those I care about.,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"I love this app. This is the app I have been looking for. It not only reminds you of birthdays but if you put in the year they were born it will give you their age. You can also move it to future years by swiping right to left. And concerning your complaints about the notifications not working, it may be because they are not clicking on ""confirm"". I had that problem and then realized I had to click ""confirm"", after I did that I started getting the notifications",5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Great app, but thereʼs one thing which bothers me because '112th' in the app is '112nd'.",5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"I love how easy it is to add birthdays, however reminders are inconsistent. If I restart my phone, I'll get a ton of reminders all at once--basically all of the birthdays that occurred in the last two months. If I open the app, I will get reminders that day and sometimes the next 2-3 days, but that's it. I really need reminders to pop up on their own.",2
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"It's amazing! It detects the age of the person but it's kinda late to the events that will happen but I don't really care. If you're looking to a smart app that detect someone's age, use this app!",5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Good app but alarm doesn't work even you have set a time and day. Missed many dates after installing this app. Need to open the app and check everytime. Not happy with this app.,3
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,This app is super easy to use and quickly keep track of birthdays. The only thing I would change is being able to zoom in on the birthdays individually month by month instead of the whole year on one page.,5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Terrible! The only time reminders show are if I go to the app and open it or touch the icon for the app. Absolutely Pointless!,1

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Love it. So simple, just what you need !",5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I love this app and how they lay out the calender but I do wish that it had a holiday calender too. It might not be what they are advertising on thair page but I would just want that to be added. Over all great app love the notification message that you get on the day.,4
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Good app, but the one huge flaw it does have (for me at least) is well... huge. I don't get birthday notifications unless I open the app. I've checked the settings on both my phone and on the app so I can keep my friends Bdays in there, I just have to put them in another thing with notifications, so might as well not use this at all. Sorry mate.",1

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Notification settings are on everywhere but app only notifies me of a birthday when the app is actively running. Absolutely useless,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"The only problem I see in this app is , it should make a sound when reminding of a birthday because there are lot of messages so i usually click to clean all messages... after all it is really good and easy to use.... but please fix this problem so that i can give it a 5 star",4
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,It's amazing,4
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Makes me keep track of everyones birthday, so helpful and I think everyone needs it",5

The notifications have to be 8am, doesn't really matter but the option to choose would be better. You can put anything you want to in the notification it's up to you. You can type anniversary or other significant occasion it doesn't have to be just birthday.

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Super duper,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,It's great app but there are 2 disadvantages (in my opinion): 1. It should have Google Account because if the app is deleted mistakenly then we can download it and add our Google account into it and can get our all birthdays automatically saved in it otherwise in real no data is saved. 2. Notification doesn't comes itself in the notification bar... When we open the app then only the notification comes,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,This is very useful app & very easy to use and ismai Birthdays likh kar aise hi chor do iski tension mat lo ki kahi ham kisi ka Birthday toh nhi bhul rhe na ye khud hi yaad dila deta hai maine ismai time set kiya hai ki jiska bhi jis din Birthday toh ye app uss din mere ko 12bje pm par yaad dila de. So Thank you so much for making this app bahut hi acha app hai ye aur helpful bhi hai ismai sirf Birthdays hi ham daal sakte hai lekin mai isme mai koi important din bhi ho toh mai wo bhi daalti hoon,5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Works well for me! Never missed a birthday greeting for the important ppl. Though, I think the app looks better on light mode. Hoping there is/will be an option for this. :)",5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,this app works really well I like that you can change the color of the icons and how many options you have I also like all the notifications it sends when a birthday is coming and happening I also like that this has no adds.,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Love this app!!! Makes keeping track of birthdays so easy!!!,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,so simple to use!!!!,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I'm getting notifications a day after everyone's birthday. What's the point?,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I really love this app its so good it mind me about bdays and that's help alot. You my 2nd favorite game,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"u saved some space in my memory 😂,,tq",5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Tommy Hilfiger and Brain Brontosaurus,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Vvvv. Good app love it,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I can see my friends bday so I Dont forget,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"I like the app, but it doesn't show the notifications unless i open it, it doesn't fulfill the purpose of reminding birthdays",1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I can remember people's birthday,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Good. Does exactly what it says.,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"It would be nice to see the developer respond to users comments, requests and problems. I find the app useful. A few improvement would give it 5 stars. 1. When entering a person's name in the calendar, it would be a help if the first letter of a name defaulted to Upper Case. 2. When entering the birth year, the only option is to use the spinner. The ability to tap on the year field and use a key pad to enter the year would be a great improvement. Other Android apps use this feature.",4
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I get the notification that there is a birthday that day after I open the app,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Helps me remember the birthdays and so i don't get embarrassed asking the same person 20 times for their birthday date Would get %100,5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,good so far,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,One of the best app,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,After reading the earlier review by Chele I was hesitant to get this app. The comment said that the app didn't allow you to manually enter birthdays and could only import them. This was definitely not true and it's been super easy to input b-days without any import at all!,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"This app has one small but major flaw, it doesn't tell you that later on you can add birthdays manually (yes you can) and it also doesn't show an obvious way of skipping the synchronization process from other calendars, which will cause a percentage of people to automatically delete the app (still don't know if it's possible to skip). Otherwise, it's a great app! I just wish the app made sure to tell you about the manual birthdays first thing and a ""skip synchronization"" button.",4
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Goes off on the wrong days and not at 8am like I set it.,2
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Nice,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Useless,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"This is amazing but, you can make something different in this app like you you can another opinion 1) reminder 2) birthday poems 3) birthday songs 4)beautiful location to go on birthday 4) birthday wallpapers 5) give idea for what to give gift on birthday 🎊 6) birthday live wallpapers. Do you like my wishes so plz fulfill it OK.",5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,it's pretty good- I am horrible at remembering birthdays and honestly this helps allot,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I give it three star's because it just gave me a notification on the same day as someone birthday but I set it for two days before when I went on the app I got three notifications but two for the same person so I remember there birthday I just have the app just in case I forgot but I didn't so I said happy birthday to my friend yesterday and happy birthday to cousin today I don't have a notification for someone who's birthday is tomorrow tho idk,3

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I almost forgot my one birth day but birthdays reminded me I downloaded it on my dad's phone and it work great,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,It would be nice if the developer responded to users comments.,3

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Very good! Easy to use and does what it says, I really love the graphics as well.

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"Well, this download was a waste of time.

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I am putting in full dates for birthdays and clicking the check mark to save them. However if I make them show up as repeating they show up as being the wrong day. I know that I am putting them in correctly. Also I have 2 birthdays that are on the same day but different years and it is not letting me keep them both there. One gets put on the day before the other gets put on the correct day.,2

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,Thank you very much. This is the app that I am waiting for,5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,I downloaded the app with hopes of keeping all my family birthdays in one place. One major issue when I open the app it won't do anything. The screen has the little character at the bottom with 3 circles that you usually see to swipe to go through more screens. It doesn't do anything but make confetti come from the sides of my screen on either side. Clicking onhim or anywhere else on the screen does nothing but more animations. I've completely closed the app several times and still nothing.,1
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"This is a great app, it's so easy to put a birthday up, all u have to do is click the month and it comes up with all the birthdays u have put on that month, I don't just use it for birthday, and that's great so I don't have to use to apps. My fam is kinda big so this app helps alot.",5

dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,"App is good, anymations are too heavy and use resources,make them faster, lighter. Would be cool to have a widget and being able to ad a face to the upcoming birthday. Thabk you for this app.",5
dev.cwolf.birthdaycalendar,A Google user,This is the best,5
