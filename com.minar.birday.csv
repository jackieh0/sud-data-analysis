com.minar.birday,Nishaad,so good,5
com.minar.birday,Con Siannis,only just installed the app. like that it has death anniversary and name days. very easy to use and backup to csv file. Just waiting to see what power consumption is like. love not getting adds every time like other birthday reminder apps.,5
com.minar.birday,Michael G,great application,5
com.minar.birday,Portugal Vodafone,"Nice app, easy to use. Hopefully one day Lunar Calendar can be added and then I will buy it from Play Store even if it is no longer free.",4
com.minar.birday,Bilal Awan,Best App,5
com.minar.birday,Keith Ryder-West,This is beautiful app which does it's job perfectly and is offered free of charge. Impossible to rate it lower than 5 stars! I love the fact that it's got multiple categories so I can flag anniversaries of death and pray for people on the day they departed this life to go to God. It's lovely to see a favourite photo of your loved ones as you remember them. Emojis are supported so you can customise further and highlight chosen names. Thanks for sharing your talent as a programmer 👍,5
com.minar.birday,Joan Tilston,"So far I think this is going to be good. One thing I would change though. Having the main notification on the day and not setting another notification means users could forget the event. I wouldn't like to see a notification on the event day and realise I hadn't bought a card, gift etc. I'd change the main one to the day before at 8am and still allow the addition of further notifications.",4
com.minar.birday,Paul Caroccio,I love Birday! Easiest App to use.,5

com.minar.birday,Elis Wolff,"I’ve been using this app for a few years and it’s one of the rare ones that gets everything right: simple, minimal, and easy to use. No clutter, no unnecessary features—just exactly what I need, and it works perfectly. I recently switched to iPhone and couldn’t find anything comparable, even after trying several alternatives. This is genuinely the app I miss the most. I hope one day there's a version of this app there too!",5
com.minar.birday,Sallie Kidman,simple. effective.,5
com.minar.birday,Claudio Yanes,"A friend recommended it to me because I always forget about birthdays (same as him). i was unconvinced why I needed another app when I already had the dates on my contacts. then I installed the app and was like ""oh, that's why"".",5
com.minar.birday,Dipanshu Sabharwal,"Does what it is supposed to do. I would've rated it 5 stars but I've been facing an import backup issue. I recently factory reset my phone. Took a backup beforehand, so no worries, I thought. Now I am trying to restore it, it simply won't. It does nothing after an import file selection. For now, I just have this app with no data to feed.",4
com.minar.birday,Pete,ripper free app. thank you. a small bug if you add a pic yourself it doesn't seem to hold and I see there is no permission for the photo gallery maybe that's the problem. The icon could be prettier too. And where's a donation button? 🙏🙂🙂,5

com.minar.birday,Andy Stockton,"Still liking the app very much but wondering if there is a way to add events that don't occur on a specific date but are tied to something like ""2nd Sunday in May"" for instance. Perhaps I just didn't find it, but if not, please consider this a feature request. And many thanks for creating an ad free public service app.",5

com.minar.birday,_Garfeld,"very cool, very necessary",5
com.minar.birday,Amzad Hosein,"it's alright so far. would be nice to choose whether Feb 29th birthdays should be on February 28th (app defaults to Match 1st with no way to change it even though that's 366 days rather than 365). would also be nice to create event types instead of just ""other"".",4
com.minar.birday,Carlo Visser,"This app is perfect for me. It's simple, functional, and it looks great. it does exactly what I want it to do.",5

com.minar.birday,Stella Lund,easy to use. love the animation on birthdays great FREE app. thank you,5
com.minar.birday,Michael Luchinsky,"The app UI is a perfect balance of beauty and functionality.

com.minar.birday,Valerie,"Terrific App! I really do love this app. it has made keeping track of special days so easy. I open it up and can immediately see the upcoming days, the age or anniversary year number, and how many days until. I don't remember any ads, so maybe I pay for the app, I really don't remember, but I don't notice any. I can't recommend this highly enough!",5
com.minar.birday,Paul Tyrrell,Love it 😀,5
com.minar.birday,Jeremy Norman,"Does everything I need it to. Only ""feature"" I don't like is the date needs to be written backwards when I manually fill it in. e.g. 10/09/2025 instead of 09/10/2025 (9th of October) Operator error. Changed language to Aussie and no worries mate. Cheers for the reply!",5

com.minar.birday,Hannah Ansley,"It's functional, it's simple, it's exactly what it says it is. No annoying ads. This is exactly the app I was hoping to find.

com.minar.birday,James Rycman,"nice fun simple app with cool effects. Suggestion: not all dates are birthdays, so it would be nice to display the label",4
com.minar.birday,Tina O.,"I love that this app lets you keep track of important dates. The app is user friendly, and the customization is nice.

com.minar.birday,dwarka gaggar,it is good in all respect.it cover all requirements,4
com.minar.birday,Jim Sellers,"Great app. it does what it needs to for alerting events (bdayzs & anniv.) Very important to me is a feature that sorts birGrooming! first name! I have many relatives and using my own sort alpha string, I can arrange everyone by family grooping! That one feature is not in most apps.",5
com.minar.birday,Jessica Adams,"Does exactly what I want it to. And bonus, the little bird icon in the notification tray actually flaps! It's cute!",5

com.minar.birday,Nokia,very helpful app,5
com.minar.birday,Harry Seldon,"The app is generally useful and has a clean interface, but I missed an important event because the notification didn’t show up or was too easy to miss. That really hurt the experience for me. Notifications need to be more reliable or customizable. If that gets fixed, it would definitely be worth a higher rating.",2

com.minar.birday,Igor Stoiljkovic,"Great app. Now you can finally ditch your FB account, you don't have excuse any more.

com.minar.birday,Pejman Dashti,"Hey, the last time I had this cool app was the previous version when the app icon was green. After I've changed my cell phone, I exported a backup, app saved it in .xml format, but I could not import it on my new phone, so I stopped using it. Today, I found out this app had an update, but still, the import of my old update is not working. Is there any way to fix this? I mean, manually entering 100 birthday events once more is so laborious. I ranked 3 stars only because of this inconvenience.",3

com.minar.birday,Ismaila Sulaimon,This app is very very good. I do enjoy it seriously.,5
com.minar.birday,AzuTea,"I make a note on here every time i hear a birth date of someone i know. My casual friends are always surprised & flattered when I shoot them a personal msg on their birthday. It makes me happy to see how special they feel & how thoughtful they think i am. In reality, I'm someone who walks into a room & stops for a solid two minutes trying to remember why I even walked in there (multiple times, daily). Thx Birday!",5

com.minar.birday,Lisa Mollison,I do like the app very much. I switched from an Apple iPhone to a Pixel. On my Apple phone I used an App called Occasions. I was able to have a red dot show on the screen when an occasiona was coming up. Is there something like that on Birday? For me that would be the finishing touch that would give this app a 5 ⭐,4
com.minar.birday,Gokuldas Amonkar,I wish automatic google backup was available which was not based on contacts or else a file was easily exportable.,5
com.minar.birday,Aureo Resende,"I love the app, only thing I could ask for would be to have multiple events for the one person, eg: ive got a friend who passed away, and I've had to create a separate profile for him for his passing, it would be great if I could add the D.O.D. to his D.O.B. other than that, keep up the great work",5

com.minar.birday,Kate Dawn,Thank you,5
com.minar.birday,nskdnnm #,"Fantastic UI and decent set of features, but why there's no search button for the birthdays, or a way to recover deleted events? It'd be great if I could simply hide or disable notifications (like a blacklist) for some contacts, rather then delete them completely. Edit: there's a search bar, I see it now. Updated to 4⭐️. Hope the blacklist gets added soon! Thanks for the reply",4
com.minar.birday,Gerald Crosby,"Just a simple,easy birthday, anniversary reminder.",5
com.minar.birday,M. Chartier,Keeps crashing. Dates only set with month before days (02.24.2024) and I did not find where to change that. Interface is simple which is nice.,2
com.minar.birday,Nelyze Mae Herodias,"Very Intuitive, my favorite birthday calendar so far. I love all the features, the widget, quick apps, and the countdown! Also the ability to add image, and the statistics and zodiac, also the yearly view, love it! I just wish that in the next update it will include the fixes where when I will import from the my Google calendar it will be able to determine the tag was a birthday not others. Also I hope it will be able to fetch the birth year correctly so that I will no longer need to edit.",5
com.minar.birday,Britto Alosious,Very useful and user-friendly app for your favourite birthdays,5
com.minar.birday,Patrick Jones,I like the way the information I want is organized and presented. It is also SO nice to have a free app without ads!,5

com.minar.birday,Alvin Tabun,I love it,5
com.minar.birday,Manjy,Good app.,5
com.minar.birday,Steven McCarty,"One of my contacts had no year and the app showed they were turning hundreds of years old. So, I updated the contact with the year and also added the contacts middle name. After the app synced again, there were duplicates in the app; One with the middle name, the other without. I had to manually delete the duplicate. Maybe use a unique identifier (_ID maybe) so that all contact editable information can change without losing the connection and causing duplicates. Otherwise, great app!!",3
com.minar.birday,Johana,"The app is amazing, very simple and easy to use, the only issue I have is that I don't get notifications. I checked the settings both in the app and general app settings of my phone, everything should be fine but it doesn't work. Edit: disabled the battery optimization as advised, hope that solves it, thank you dev :) Edit 2: it works",5

com.minar.birday,raghunath mhale,Perfect app for birthday record. Deserve 5 star rating.,5
com.minar.birday,Dawid Kwiecien,Intuitive and the animations are really nice. Only thing I wish it'd have was a way to see EVERY upcoming birthday for all your friends rather than just the nearest one. I thought the little arrow at the top of your screen would do that but it actually hides the closest birthday so i think that'd be a good change. Edit: realised you can do this by favouriting all your contacts but I still think that's not very clear.,5
com.minar.birday,Ali Besharati,Hey there tnx for the great app . Love the UI and smoothnes Only if you could add other calender formats like hijri ( arabic ) and shamsi ( persian ) it would be the best app available for birthdays Really appreciate it if you could consider it,5

com.minar.birday,Kristian,"What a great experience! I was so tired and annoyed at the other apps on the market, flashing ads in your face constantly. This one has everything I need, thanks for making this! 🤩 Apart from having a hard time finding the ""Donate""-button (very refreshing, compared to the money grabbing competitors), I would love it if the widget could be adjusted to only show upcoming events for the next 4 weeks, for example. I would prefer it to be empty instead of showing birthdays 200 days from now 😊",5

com.minar.birday,Charles Van Beveren,"I've been looking for an app that shows the ages of my contacts. This one is perfect! It has everything I was looking for. Thanks!!! July 21, 2024 update: for some reason, the math is off. Someone with a birthday on July 21, 1946 is given as 77 years old.",5
com.minar.birday,Otto Elter,"The app seems fantastic, but there is a significant issue. While all dates can be imported from the contacts app, the corresponding labels cannot be imported.

com.minar.birday,ACKY WOTHRY,"Great idea but alarms don't sound. Tried this on my Huwawei tablet, Blackview tablet, and finally on my Samsung phone. The same result. Perfect for a deaf user as it's good on the visuals. I uninstalled it with great regrets as I admire the author's creativity.

I love being able to keep track of wedding and death anniversaries in my life. I also love that it is ad-free. I'm a huge fan of apps made by small devs so I'll definitely continue to use Birday for years to come.",5
com.minar.birday,DRS DIGITAL,Very good app.. Just one suggestion.. in the 'other' section an option for mentioning an event should be provided.. also if we could add a phone number or email it would be great.. thank you developers..,4
com.minar.birday,Pallavi Mishra,"Excellent, very nicely done👍",5
com.minar.birday,Nancy D,"Just transferred all the special dates from another app to Birday, and so far, it's a much better experience. One thing I'd like to see on future updates is the ability to see the notes when I open someone's event ""card"". I've been adding notes especially for the children (preferences like what kinds of toys/games they like or favorite colors, etc.)",4
com.minar.birday,Rob Ross,"Beautiful & elegant, honored to be one of your first 50k downloads",5
com.minar.birday,Sajin S,"I have been using this from a long time, has helped me with birthdays and other events.",5
com.minar.birday,Diane Kettleboro,Not a bad app. Having a dedicated space for addresses would be good. (To make it easier to send cards). Also a way to group individual family groups would be helpful. Other than that it's a really good app and very useful for me.,4
com.minar.birday,José Carvalho,In my opinion this is almost exactly what a birthday calendar should be. It is the best I tried so far! 🤗 Thank you.,5

com.minar.birday,Prathamesh Ram,"Extremely useful, if it were feasible to sync this app to a gmail account, it will be much better because I unexpectedly lost all my data when I had to switch phones Update : Thanks for your reply. However, I don't think there was an option to give my Google account, so I'm not sure how it would sync to cloud. For the backup function, is the data automatically stored in a file from which I can import in a new device or do I need to specifically make an export file by choosing that option?",4
com.minar.birday,Mirko Bucan,Useful little app. Does what it's supposed to. No bugs for now.,5

com.minar.birday,S V,"Useless, not user friendly. No wally to import data from a file. Difficult to enter DOB of many friends. Of the app designer thinks otherwise, he should guide me on how to optimise use of the app including how to import data from excel file rather than rake an excuse that 3000 other people think otherwise. I am open to correction and learning but not willing to take it lying down",1
com.minar.birday,Carlos Damian Quintero Alfeiran,"I found the labs option to update automatically but is as experimental, but it has save me a couple of times so it really fulfills the objective of letting me know of the birthdays just wish the experimental options had some detailed explanation as the name doesn't appear to be as the description",5

I had a suggestion for a small QOL feature update: When adding an anniversary, oftentimes, you know both people involved in the anniversary (e.g. your parents' wedding anniversary), so it would be nice if we could add 2 (or more) people to the same event potentially.

Also has anniversary and ""other"" for you to put whatever you want. I do have a couple of suggestions. 1. I'd really love to see a calendar with all the birthdays laid out on it rather than a list. 2. Adding in new dates is hard.

com.minar.birday,Kyle Telke,Great app for keeping everything together. I have found that it is one of the best apps for tracking more than just birthdays effectively. The only added feature that would have made it 5 stars for me is the ability to sync the dates with a calendar.,4

com.minar.birday,Lawrence Boucher (Laed),Great app very user friendly,4
com.minar.birday,Sri Harsha M,"Loved this App. One suggestion. When we have multiple event for same contacts, then it is not showing difference between birthday and anniversary. It would be better to have it in description while importing.",4
com.minar.birday,Robert dunlap,Good app,5
com.minar.birday,Prem R,Simple but beautiful,5
com.minar.birday,ROG CLIPSHAM,"Provisional remarks and score. Still entering data so not tested yet. Got this as it appears to meet my requirements most closely. Takes some getting used to, as not quite intuitive and still discovering features. So far worst aspect is that in the main view the 3 android icons become invisible though present at foot.",4
com.minar.birday,Akio Sato,"Super straightforward, clutter-free and convenient. I love that you can change the accent colour!",5

com.minar.birday,Sponge Elfe,"Everyone saying this app ""isn't good"" or ""lacks features"" are honestly just hard to please lol. First of all, the ui is simple yet pleasant to look at. There's also a dark mode (ty sm :D) which is a blessing, truly. The purpose of the app is easily met and adding events is easy and intuitive! It also has a system that allows you to view astrology signs for bday's (which is awesome for those interested or curious). Also remember this dude is doing this all for FREE. Would recommend n-n",5
com.minar.birday,Cece Ange,It's good,5
com.minar.birday,Lisa Gomez,"All apps should be able to install on all devices, this app is really need on my device SMS-550 but it's not letting me (I need it to be on all devices regardless what they are)! SMS-550 & 580 Samsung Galaxy Tab Android",3

com.minar.birday,Araina Rai,Everything is amazing I just wish there were ways to decorate the app because the layout is quite boring,4
com.minar.birday,Dena Jenkins,"Super easy and keeps me out of the ""Belated"" lane.",5
com.minar.birday,Thomas Emms,Keeps me from missing those important dates,5
com.minar.birday,Rahul Sashi,"Edit 2: 3 stars is because functionality that is currently present can be done using Google Tasks. If implementation of time zones and notification can be further customized, then this app has a reason to exist. Edit 4: I didn't say it's useless. I said it offers nothing new compared to existing apps such as Google Tasks which everyone would use over this. Don't know why you are taking it so personally.",1
com.minar.birday,Carlos Vesta,Good.,5
com.minar.birday,Lea Br.,"It WAS a great app, until it lost ALL the birthdays...again...when I changed phones. And yes, I did the pre-change backups. The other birthday app kept all the information. I just don't feel like entering all the data again, so despite prefering the layout of this app, keeping the data is more important.",2

com.minar.birday,Paula Connolly,"Great little app, nothing to dislike. Does exactly what it's supposed to do!",5
com.minar.birday,OneJohnFiveTwelve,"Back in March I commented, ""The app is a neat one but I'm a little disappointed that it has to remain ""open"" (or loaded) to notify of a birthday due to occur."" I neglected to email as I was very short of time. HOWEVER, I've since upgraded to A Note 10 and been through the transfer system, but no events transferred. I guess I have to find the data file and copy it across. What is it called and where will I find it?",4
com.minar.birday,Ashweak Nnaik,Thanks for reminding me about the special day:),5

com.minar.birday,Rajesh Singh,Cannot import birthdays from Facebook or other platforms. It's also unable to fetch data from .csv file I exported from another birthday App. It says file imported but no birthdays are added. Syncing with Fb would be useful as it would tremendously reduce the labor to manually add all birthdays not to mention Photo.,3

com.minar.birday,Madhu Lambu,"I have contacts in my phone book (Android) with their birthdays stored and also their children's birthdays stored using custom labels. The app shows these events too as the contact's birthday. You may want to show the custom label maybe? If you are able to show it in notes, you may very well want to consider having it included in the title too? Giving five stars just because the developer is all ears to suggestions!",5

com.minar.birday,Niraz,Wowie wow. Best app.,5
com.minar.birday,Kathy Krock,It's not what I expected. I was looking for a notebook app where I can just write in people's names and birthdays. (Like an address book) This app isn't the easiest to work with. I started putting names in alphabetically then the app switched my list putting the names by birthday month which confused me at first. It may not work for me but it may work out for someone else.,2

com.minar.birday,Realm Riot,"It's a nice enough app. Very useful and pleasing to look at but it would be nice if the notification for death anniversary could be changed to something a lot less jolly maybe lol. Reminded of someone's death but then: ""Have a great day!"" 😅",4

com.minar.birday,Ashish Prajapati,"Hello developer, I loved this app, only thing that i think this app lacks in is system accent. you should try increasing color options, or i would recommend a hex code or such for a user to pick accent color of his choice. thank you!",5
com.minar.birday,Jennifer Kiny,"Why am I not receiving notifications?.. wow what a reply ... I had already disabled the battery optimisation. Whether the app is free or not, every user has the right to ask why is the app not working on his or her mobile properly. I had posted a question, not a negation.",1

com.minar.birday,Mihai Valentin,"What good is the ""null"" displayed for name fields that are empty? Like ""null John Doe"". I really would like this to disappear. My suggestion: Just use the available info, in the order it appears in Google Contacts. Otherwise, the app works well.",4

com.minar.birday,Roko Dobovičnik,"Animations are very nice, and everything works perfectly, without any ads. The only thing I would add is an option for the app to notify me more than once before the day of actual event. For example I want it to notify me 5 days before but also a day before an event. Maybe this feature already exists but I was not able to find it. Anyway, special thanks to the creator. Keep up with good work.",5

com.minar.birday,Michael Tsoller,"Love the app! Been using it for a while. What made me remove 1 star is the new widget. I keep it on my main screen as a 1x4 and it's completely illegible now. Would love to see the simple one liner return as an option. Will definitely rate 5 stars when it does! Thank you for your creativity. EDIT: Widget was changed, am giving this app 5⭐",5
com.minar.birday,Surjaa Chakravarti,"Update: Back to old widget, back to 5 stars 😁 PS - where can I report a bug? Previous: This is definitely a 5 star app (and that was my previous rating) but the new widget has made it almost impossible for me to effectively use the app. Saw from the developer's comments on other reviews that they plan to bring back the previous widget. I'm looking forward to that and will surely update my rating back to 5 stars when that happens.",5

com.minar.birday,David Stefan,"Great app, just that a language option would be usefull as the only way to change it now is using the phone's language setting",5
com.minar.birday,Peter Salmon,"Outstanding app - free, ad-free, and full of functionality without being overcomplicated. The only thing I would change is the icon - the gray outline extends out of the safe area in the top left, which doesn't look great with circle icons.",5
com.minar.birday,Mr Nobody,Perfect! Be like this in future too (without ads and paid app),5
com.minar.birday,Pierre ROUCHES CANAHUATE,"I love it ! It's the best app I know to remember my friend's and family's birthdays. The only problem I found is that when I import birthdays from Google contacts without year of birth specified, it appears in the app as born in 1904. But I would recommend it anyway.",4
com.minar.birday,Mehul Tandel,Its an awesome app.. and completely free... It is the best.,5
com.minar.birday,Karen Platt,"This is an excellent app,I can't forget important events now Thank you!",5
com.minar.birday,Ilene Erasmus,Helps me remember everyone's birthday in time! It's a great assistant. Thank you.,5
com.minar.birday,Ngapox,Awesome,5
com.minar.birday,Rieve Reynolds,Just started this.,5
com.minar.birday,Mike VanDzura,Not really user friendly.,4
com.minar.birday,Paula Moldenhauer,I like the concept. Mostly intuitive to use. But I am having trouble setting up as many reminders as I want.,4
com.minar.birday,Wawan Kuncoro,Load birthday from Facebook,3
com.minar.birday,Janey Barrow,"This a lovely simple app with a clear interface and is easy to use. It would be useful to see the age of the person in the list of names view. Also the date format is different depending on whether the year is present or not. Otherwise, it ticks all boxes!",5
com.minar.birday,Cody R,"Great app! Would be greater if we could custom name our ""Other"" events. 👍👍",5
com.minar.birday,Corinne Caccetta,"Do Like This App, Easy To Use, 1 Little Fault When You Enter Birthday If You Don't know the Year It Won't Let You Put Entry In. So You Have To Make Year Up. Other Than That It Does What It's Supposed To.",4

com.minar.birday,Prasun Paul,Working well so far.,5
com.minar.birday,SiD,I just have 1 suggestion: In additional reminder if there's an option for 12 hours before then it would be great by this you can get notified for a birthday at 11pm and also 11am next morning.,5
com.minar.birday,Kushra Leigh Price,"Great app, does the job. Not flashy",5
com.minar.birday,Kaisan Khasru,"Good interface, fun to use.",5
com.minar.birday,RiownerTias,"I am satisfied with this app so far after the last app I chose stopped functioning correctly. It is a smooth app offering a few extras than expected, including random stat and trivia (do feel it's the same list now but new entries can potentially fix that) It is nice I still get to see both western and eastern signs. While I'm sad to say goodbye to the eastern zodiac elements from my previous choice, I still say it's worth the switch. :)",5
com.minar.birday,Arsh Shaikh,"Great app. Loved the UI and the animations! Q: how does the cloud backup work? Edit: There is no option to enable it in the settings. PS: Birthdays are not imported from contacts, does Cloud Backup have any reliance on it?",4
com.minar.birday,Lewis K,"I would like to see a countdown of days, the ability to see their upcoming age on the list, and a setting to remove the Chinese sign which I have no interest in Edit: Doesn't seem like you're open for suggestions yet are using the free and open source line for better reviews. I would have improved my review of you were open but seems like being highly rated is your only concern.",2

com.minar.birday,Uma Narayan,Good,5
com.minar.birday,John C J,"Was looking for something like this. This was featured on HowToMen YT channel's top opensource apps (June 2022). My only gripe is like other calender apps, it need first name+last name. People generally use informal nicknames for keeping track of birthdays (I don't plan on sync-ing the app with my contacts). I hope in future updates, there will be an option for just name+description (also good for anniversaries). If you are planning on expanding, how about Indian/Vedic astrological names too?",5
com.minar.birday,J Colt,Nice app.,5
com.minar.birday,Runil Amonkar,Light weight super app! Does what you want.,5
com.minar.birday,Abhishek Savakar,Simple and no ads,5
com.minar.birday,Shila Chaudhari,"It's the best app, I have ever seen I have tried many other apps but they are not working well. So, guys if you don't want to miss any birthdays or events, just download this app.❤👍❤",5
com.minar.birday,Susan Frater,"I just wanted an easy and uncomplicated birthday and anniversary reminder, and that is what this app gives! Easy to use, very happy.",5
com.minar.birday,Lisa Bennett,Love it !! Great way to organise your Birthday/Anniversary events. I am a new user so havent tried the notification alert as yet but love its FREE and Ad free !!,5
com.minar.birday,Nidula Fonseka,It's so easy to use and does exactly as you would expect. Importing from contacts was very useful as well. Changes the birthday game.,5
com.minar.birday,Deborah Kolda,"I have only accessed the Birthday function so far, but i'm loving it. I here it has an anniversay function also which i'll be checking out next!",5
com.minar.birday,Magomed Ibragimov,"Great app! My suggestion for app improvement: add option to make notifications sticky, i.e. it prevents user from swiping the notification away until they clicked ""Ok"" option under the notification (if they enabled it in the settings). Example of such functionality can be found in open source android app Habits Loop Tracker (which is written mostly in cotlin): Habits Loop Tracker --> three vertical dots in the right top corner --> Settings --> ""Reminder"" section --> ""Make notifications sticky""",5
com.minar.birday,Nisha Shetty,The app gives reminder only if the app is opened,1
com.minar.birday,Gia Novak,Not interactive,1

com.minar.birday,Mansi Singh,Very nice app,5
com.minar.birday,jacqui coffin,"I love this app. It just does what it is meant to without trying to be too clever and that is why it is outstandingly brilliant! Input is so straightforward, graphics clear and unclutteted. You can choose when to set reminders. I haven't tried input and output yet, but the option is there. If there are ads I really haven't noticed them. I don't often leave reviews but work of this standard needs to be acknowledged. Seriously if you need a birthday app. this is the one to get.",5
com.minar.birday,angela prabhakar,Really liking this app! Was easy to input the dates and names. Sent me a reminder like I asked for before and day of birthday. So far so good so therefore I highly recommend it!,5
com.minar.birday,Bob Morris,One of the best Birthday reminder apps that I have tried. Very flexible and easy to use. Allows recording anniversaries and other events easily and allows you to use your own graphics to customise events. Only slight downsides is that you can't record two people on a Wedding Anniversary for instance by inserting a '&' or enter any other symbol into the name field. You can however import names which include symbols if they are already present. The developer seems very responsive. Great app 👍.,5
com.minar.birday,E,It didn't remind me.,1
com.minar.birday,Tony Collie,"Indispensable, easy to use, and I love the bird sound!",5
com.minar.birday,baje4 Lic,Awesome app. I ove it very much,4

com.minar.birday,G. Moore,"I would like the option to separate family birthdays from the rest. Living in Deutschland with the rest of my family in the UK, it's getting very hard to keep up to date with an ever expanding huge family.",4
com.minar.birday,Tiffany Ramirez,I can not get past inserting the name. The insert birthday button does not work! Fix please! I had high hopes for this app. Help me help you lol,1
com.minar.birday,Krystian Szuwi,Only review update. From 5/5 to 10/5,5
com.minar.birday,Vaibhav Mishra,It a mind-blowing app with fluent design and cool animations and most useful app.,5
com.minar.birday,Harley Bolvin,Great! Love the reminders. I wish it had a notes section to out gift ideas/or a check mark box for bought gift or mailed card and it would show me what i sent last years etc. But regardless I am going to keep the app and have recommended it to several people already!,4
com.minar.birday,David Baker,"It's a slick app, but is missing the key feature i want: show me how much time until each person's birthday. It only shows you that for one person at a time, whoevers birthday is next. Even the widget only shows 1 person, even if there's another birthday the very next day.",4
com.minar.birday,Alberto Pedron,Utilissima per non dimenticare i compleanni,5
com.minar.birday,Puffin 364,"Not working as it should. The notifications only show up when I open the app, even though I have the notifications abled on my Samsung. Any idea on why this isn't working anymore?",4
com.minar.birday,Reef Picu,"Very good app, but visually changes are needed... This app looks very old and simple visually.",4
com.minar.birday,Cable Freebase,This guys makes the best apps!,5
com.minar.birday,Weronika,"Good, allows me to effectively not forget anyone's birthday, and it's amazing anyway.",5
com.minar.birday,John Tielemans,"Easy to set up, does almost exactly what I need. A nice, but not critical, addition would be to show more birthdays if the widget is expanded.",5
com.minar.birday,Diana S.,Super cute & accurate!,5
com.minar.birday,Marie Walters,New to this app. All seems ok at present.,4
com.minar.birday,A Scott,"Love that I can keep this completely separate from my contacts and that it doesn't rely on cloud or Google for back-ups/import/export! But if you want it will retrieve birthdays from your contacts. Developer was quick to respond when I had a question. Thank you for sharing your skills, Minar! Changing from 4 to 5 stars now that all the new features are working correctly. Thanks again!!",5
com.minar.birday,Pat Hanbury,I am happy to have one place to track all the birthdays for my friends and family. It is easy to use. I love to acknowledge others' birthdays! Simple and easy.,5
com.minar.birday,mahiuddin ibnul,"A simply beautiful and elegant app. It helps me a lot to remember my cousin, niece and nephew's Birthdays. Thanks Birday.",5
com.minar.birday,Travis Nolan,This keeps me track about my birthdays in my family,5
com.minar.birday,Mike Miller,Simple and effective. I've only had thus app a couple weeks and it's given 2 notifications already for family and friends birthdays. The icon on my notification bar is animated and stands out well so you don't miss it! Thanks for a great app,5
com.minar.birday,Steven Lim,"Nice layout and does what is supposed to do. I like that it shows Western and Chinese Zodiac signs. Would be better if it also showed Anniversary and Other dates. Widget and contact list view would be better if it shows age of upcoming event against each contact, in addition to the date. Option to remove header from widget and show more contacts. Option to configure days in advance in widget, different to notification days.",4
com.minar.birday,Graham McGregor,"Works well for what it is, but has limited functionality. I'd like to be able to configure the widget for how many days ahead it shows",4
com.minar.birday,Per-Christian Snarud Føll,Easily the best brithday app ever. It's both free AND ad-free! It runs smooth as butter and you can even personalize the color of the app itself.,5
com.minar.birday,Beck Barnett,"Good app I like that the next person in your list who's birthday it is shows on your home screen. Good reminder especially if you need to buy & send them something, especially with knowing postal delays. You can also add the persons photo to their birthday profile thing, but my only suggestion would be to be able to zoom in on them and/or crop others out but no complaints.",5
com.minar.birday,Riley Everett,"Fantastic App. Best I've seen for birthdays. Looking forward to the next major update. Hope it's soon, been checking everyday for the past month. That's how much I love this app. A+",5
com.minar.birday,Nick Darone,"Excellent app! Thank you for making and maintaining this. 2 things I'd love to see, if possible. A relationship option. (Mom, Dad, Uncle, Aunt, etc.) And the ability to sync contacts from a specific account. Right now, it grabs all contacts. I'd love to leave work people out of it. Lol.",5
com.minar.birday,SAYON,🙂,5
com.minar.birday,JTK III,Simple to install simple to use fills a very specific need. The app imported birthdays from my contacts but then allowed me to enter new birthday reminders for people not in my contacts - like young grandchildren that do not have a phone!,5
com.minar.birday,Pulkit Bhardwaj,"I love your app really, the UI design is great, And you can import birthday from calendar by taking calender permission and filter all event which contain birthday!!, simple. And sorry for my bad tone, your app is great and I am a big supporter of open course apps, thanks for your contribution.",4

com.minar.birday,Amanda Jones,"Absolutely perfect for exactly what I needed. Let's me look forward at whose birthday is coming up easier than a calendar does. Love being able to look at certain folks/birthdays such as friends' kids and others I wouldn't think to watch for for their birthday.

com.minar.birday,Sonal Uban,"Simple, intuitive and works!",5
com.minar.birday,Lex,"I love it. Simple. Ad free. Does exactly what I need, plus extra stats, and organization is great.",5
com.minar.birday,Leigh Everett,"Would love to have Anniversarys, others etc and Calendar View. Also, notes on all Birthdays not just favourite. Also, stats that show days, months, years of age would be great to add to the profile view. Over all, It's a Fantastic app, Nice and clean looking as well. With the above ideas added it will be the best app of this type. AAA+ Thanks love your work.",5

com.minar.birday,Sruthy CM,It's awesome 🔥♥ easy to use and the reminder also so perfect 👌💯 thanks team for this wonderful app ♥️🥰,5
com.minar.birday,VIDYESH NANGARE,"Very simple design, easy to figure out, can edit details and even add profile photos of people you wanna make a birthday reminder for, amazing app for those who forget birthdays or those who like to pre plan birthday paty, app also tells zodiac and chinese sign when added appropriate birthdate of a particular person. Can also add people to favourites, notification is simple and can be noticed easily so even if you don't open the app, you still get reminded about someone's birthday. I give ★★★★★",5

com.minar.birday,ADxor,"Very nice looking app, great animations, and super easy to use. I don't see an option for other types of event such as anniversaries.

com.minar.birday,KingOvFails,Very simple. Very good. Works just as intended.,5
com.minar.birday,Kaze Xo,"I love how it's ad-free and open source, the app is the best I found (tried about 10 apps). There may be too much unnecessary greeting in the notification like ""Hi there"" and ""Have a great day"", as the notifications should be concise. An option to disable the confetti animation would be nice too. Edit: dev reply is super fast! Thanks for the info. One last suggestion: Showing the person's name at notification title and show how many days until birthday instead of just ""Upcoming birthdays"".",5
com.minar.birday,Dr. Husseinali Dattoo,Wow,5
com.minar.birday,Akash Das,"My thoughts, Before installing: Why do we need such an app! After installing: So clean and minimalistic UI, just love the animations and does a very decent job. Kudos to the dev for making such a beautiful app. And overall, keeping it so privacy friendly.",5
com.minar.birday,Val Souza,Simple and effective. Love it!,5
com.minar.birday,Gen A,Great!,5
com.minar.birday,Shashank Pullela,Beautifully designed... Have been waiting for an app does just this.... A few suggestions would be for the widget to show more than one birthday at a time depending on its size maybe.... thank you for this beautiful app it's an eye candy.,5

com.minar.birday,Max Mavros,"Very solid app, does what it needs to and a bit more too",5
com.minar.birday,Nevena Kuzeljevic,"Hi, just wanted to say that I LOVE this app and thank you for making it FOSS. It's only missing one thing for me to make a complete switch from google calendar to this app managing my birthdays and that's notes/gift section. It would be nice if every birthday had a notes section where I could keep track of potential birthday gifts. Is it a possibility to add this? Could we expect it in the future?",5
com.minar.birday,Brian Childs,Useful,5
com.minar.birday,Leto A,"I love love love this app! It's easy to use, and so stylish that it feels expensive. It's really a joy to use!",5

com.minar.birday,Adrian,Really useful! Keeping track of birthdays is always hard but luckily this app let's you import birthdays from contacts.,5
com.minar.birday,L Hoffelder,"I'm loving how easy it is to input dates! Just click on the date, no scrolling needed once you're in the right month! I only have 2 issues. I would love an ""other"" category for anniversaries and memorial dates. Most important how can I save my data? In other apps I lose everything when I buy a new phone. It's a lot of work getting all my dates in. If I have to reinstall this app do I have to start over? Thanks for a great ad free app!",5

com.minar.birday,Antoinette Ponzo,Edited 2/18. Developer went above and beyond to help me get the app working. Definitely would recommend it for keeping track of birthdays. Calendar was stuck on today's date. I could not add information. I Uninstalled it immediately,5
com.minar.birday,Reg Dryden,So far so good.,4
com.minar.birday,Rolando,"Honestly, this should be baked into stock android by default. Super convenient and straight forward. Thanks!",5
com.minar.birday,Naveen Tennakoon,The notifications sometimes do not work and only pops up when i open the app. Otherwise an overall good app to manage the important dates.,4
com.minar.birday,Antonio Oroz,"Well, I think this is one of the easiest 5 out of 5. The app is simple and does its job. This would already do the trick. But additionally it's also ad-free, visually stunning and open source. Definitely the best app out there for Birthday Management. Thanks a lot :D",5

com.minar.birday,Jeff H,Simple but works as intended which is wonderful.,5
com.minar.birday,Thor Leslie,"Good app but backup and import to another phone fails. Both phones are exactly the same make, model, operating system and Birday versions are the same.",4
com.minar.birday,Lorenzo Rossi,"Best app of this field, the fact that it's free and open source really puts it on another level, congrats to the developer!",5
com.minar.birday,Vaishnav K Suresh,Good but the backup feature to Google cloud could be made,3
com.minar.birday,Muhammad Tayyab Sheikh,Best to get reminders and managing birthdays of your friends and family. Just a feature request to add Scheduled SMS etc for sending Birthday Wishes automatically.,5
com.minar.birday,Ashwati Sunilkumar,An amazing app with very helpful features.,5
com.minar.birday,Denice Stanfield,Love the extra info it gives.,5
com.minar.birday,Selina Lyons,"Thank you for developing such a brill app 💙 I use it to put other anniversaries - weddings|reminders to get in touch on the anniversaries of when someone may have lost a loved one. Im probs affecting my interesting statistics, so tweaking your birthday concept to suit. if you add a separate feature for these categories- you would need to change the name 😅 Great personal touch of your background and interests. You're clearly innovative and talented, I could use your expert on my projects👍🏼",5
com.minar.birday,Jeevan Pulluru,A very clean and minimal app and does what it says... Nothing more or nothing less...,5
com.minar.birday,Jeff Couch,"Does just what I need, in a simple and easy to understand manner. Really looking forward to figuring out the note option (haven't been able to see it), as then I can add other types of events.",5
com.minar.birday,Aditya Thorat,Is this app limited to birthdays only? Isn't it possible to add wedding anniversaries.,4
com.minar.birday,rohit gupta,Very intuitive app to have. It does what it says.,5
com.minar.birday,Nemanja Borovac,"Nice app. Couple of great touches. I would love if there was a way to mute certain birthdays and potentially, a way to remove/replace the STARS. Maybe use a bird logo instead. Seems a bit out of place, design wise.",4
com.minar.birday,Damiano Romita,"Simple but very functional and reliable, with clean and minimal interface. Plus, it's ad-free which is a very nice thing.",5
com.minar.birday,Nicolle Singer,"Got it, thanks!! GREAT app and very responsive developer!! :) Former comment: Good app but please add a way to easily include the year with each birthday. Right now with Android I seem to have to scroll back through each month to go back years when entering birthdays manually and that is too difficult to do for someone not born in the last few years.",5
com.minar.birday,Miles Aikens,"It does what it says, and does it well. No overreaching permissions, and no ads. Love it.",5
com.minar.birday,D,"Loved the App. It's the Best One so far. Great Work done by the Developer 👍 There can be more features added to it I feel, like Birthday Quotes.. or Birthday Cards.. I don't know if that is even possible.. But it would be great if we could have this in the App.",5
com.minar.birday,Aviv,Really cool app with a really cool ui,5
com.minar.birday,Reybhan April Panti,Would be much greater if we can add pictures on profile and also filter the dates of bdays from older to younger or the opposite.,4
com.minar.birday,Богдан Зажигин,"Идеально, тол.ко название слишком ориганальное, а так (ง ื▿ ื)ว",5

com.minar.birday,Rana Jeeth,Decent app 👍🏼,4
com.minar.birday,anth hall,I love this.,5
com.minar.birday,Eugene Koh,I really love this simplicity of the app. Although my one wish is that I can choose to have surname infront either overall or for certain contacts. Edit 2 days from first review: Thank you for the update! That was really quick and I'm so grateful for it!,5
com.minar.birday,Leonardo Rodrigues,"Absolutely awesome! Just a few capitalisation inconsistences (eg. capricorn should be Capricorn, same with the Chinese Zodiac Signs, and Months too.)",5
com.minar.birday,Ola oluwadamilare,"If I want to set a date I think it should be ahead, but your calendar does not allow me to set date ahead it only show previous dates, you app I can't say is still useful for me,wish you can do something about it.",2
com.minar.birday,Vivek Nerle,"Elegant, clean , beautiful, adfree... Wonderful package.. Deserve 5 start, but given 4 just because looking for one feature /small suggestion You given option apps to communicate like whatsapp, dialer,etc.. But you already synchronised contact list then.. why auto give no while opening dialer(may be first found no) or may be of type mobile. And same for whatsapp also. While changing day/month/year of contact, new entry added for same contact. But still thanks ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",4
com.minar.birday,Yogita Kadchha,Does the job. But I'd be better if we had an option to not add the year to some birthdays,5
com.minar.birday,Anu Anand Premji,"A true undiscovered gem. In the midst of all these shady ad infested birthday apps on the play store, this one truly stands out, being a well done high quality open source app. Suggestion: Support all sorts events like anniversary and other custom events that can be added to contacts.",5
com.minar.birday,Henrik Madsen,"Just started to use this app, so haven't had much experience with it yet, but so far I think it's great.",5
com.minar.birday,Kathleen Ike-Isakson,So far so good I would like to see an accumulation of time as well. Like hey is been 6 weeks and 4 days since my last birthday. Maybe down the road?,4
com.minar.birday,Justin Byrne,Cleaner and much more reliable than the other birthday reminder apps floating around. Simple interface with some nice flourishes in the UI. Props to the dev for making this free to use with no ads.,5
com.minar.birday,Hernan Lorenzo,"Really nice free open source application, I found and got it from F-droid. Thanks!",5
com.minar.birday,Jovian Parco,"Can you add a future where you don't need years in certain people, it hard when you know there birth day but not birth year and you don't want to ruin a beautiful app because of a year.",5
com.minar.birday,Ravi Kilnake,"It didnt work. When i opened the app then it worked and played the horn Android 8.0.0, oneplus 3t. Non roooted Unlocked version.",2
com.minar.birday,Abhishek Narayan,"Dude, this is amazing and simplistic app. Nothing beats a clean, intuitive and fast ui. My request, please add anniversary option so that I don't have to add them as bday.",5
com.minar.birday,Manjeet Singh,Awesome app,5
com.minar.birday,Johan Augustin Wågan Baustad,"Would be great if it was possible to choose a sub-calendar instead on only main google calendar. Have a separate birthdays calendar as i don't want to clutter my main calendar, but can't get the entries in this calendar into the app",3
com.minar.birday,Ranjana Tiwari,"Amazing ux. This app is light, clean and beautiful . Props to the developer",5

com.minar.birday,Christian,No ads! Whoop whoop!,5
com.minar.birday,pranay vaidya,"Best part of this app is.. it is ads free... I was searching for a ads free app, never intended to use this app, but now I am loving it... Very simple to use and doest what is meant for...",4
