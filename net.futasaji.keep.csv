net.futasaji.keep,David Brown,An excellent app which has the special advantage of allowing you to share the to do list with others and all parties can make updates. also it retains a time stamped history of the tasks,5

net.futasaji.keep,Dustin Froescul,"I am really impressed by this app, and it's free to use. Exactly what we needed and wanted. Beautiful layout, simple idea, and easily shareable! Few additions I would love to see: 1) show the day of week, when selecting a date for task 2) sub-tasks that you can add to a task and check off in same way 3) more repeat options (every 2nd week, etc...) 4) priority / urgent tasks list or checkbox or highlight 5) More colors to choose from :) Amazing app!",5
net.futasaji.keep,Hans de Bruin,"I've been using this app for a couple of months now, and it is a very good tool, very well written, easy to use, lots of options. Great job guys, thanks 👍",5
net.futasaji.keep,E M,"Sharing list doesn't work, url and qr code don't work",1
net.futasaji.keep,Eugene Vd Walt,"Useless app, need a manuel to work it, could not even get 1 note made.",1
net.futasaji.keep,Tharinda Dalpethado,"Unparalleled interface and usability, syncing is almost immediate. 👏",5
net.futasaji.keep,Brittany,Simple. Shared tasks. Can add and check off. Perfect for what I need.,5
net.futasaji.keep,Mirthe Kamp,Wish there was a widget to add to your homescreen! Otherwise really great app!,4
net.futasaji.keep,Zachary Rundell,"so far this app has been amazing for a team scheduling app, the only feature I feel it's missing is more customizable repeating options, there's only a few such as daily weekly and monthly, and some of my tasks are done every 2 weeks, or every 4 weeks, which those options don't cover so I still need to manually input them",4
net.futasaji.keep,Ayane Himiko,"""we-do"" but can't even open the link properly and QR code scanner will just let you download the app even if it's already installed. It's not even opening the invitation screen.",1
net.futasaji.keep,Katie Cormack,"If this had a Web linked version, it would be the best app of this type available.",4
net.futasaji.keep,Bees Figs,good app,5
net.futasaji.keep,Shado Mastah,"Good for planning , needs an option to set certain days of the week to be scheduled on the calendar. Not just daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, but also every Tuesdays Wednesdays, and Thursdays (examples) as well.",4
net.futasaji.keep,Redzaco Network,nice apps usefull,5
net.futasaji.keep,Greg Cormack (Excel Flooring),"This does exactly what it says on the box simple and neat, I am loving it. Personally, I would love a month selectable calendar rather than a scroll type but this is realy nothing against a great app. If this was browser enabled for PC access IMO it would be the best collaboration list I have found.",5
net.futasaji.keep,Morning Queens,Me and my fiance loved this app but unfortunately we cannot use it bcz he needs a to do app with a widget.,2
net.futasaji.keep,Aditya Kumar,"Very Nice app , Keep up the good work dev 😃 ! Me and my girlfriend use this app to share our TODO List .",5
net.futasaji.keep,A Short,cant move task to completed,1
net.futasaji.keep,Ogutu Samuel Mulijo,Great app. Does everything I wished for in a shared to-do app. Nicely designed and user friendly interface. PLEASE INCLUDE ACCESS PASSWORD OPTION.,5
net.futasaji.keep,Krystal,love how you can collaborate with others!!,5
net.futasaji.keep,Alan Arce,"Really great but it seems weird to have incompleted tasks check boxes be vibrant & the completed tasks dull. Seems like it should be backwards. After all incompleted tasks don't normally take most of your focus. Also, like other similar apps, I think when you add a new task it should auto-capitalize the first letter for you.",5
net.futasaji.keep,HandOfClay,"I really like the app! its simple and easy to use. Though I'm not quite sure if I've missed something in the settings, but I don't get a notification for events I put in my calendar. Only when I open the App, I receive the notifications.",4
net.futasaji.keep,Emerson Simmonds,Amazing. This app is awesome. If there was an option to donate to the developer for making such a well designed to-do app that would be nice. Hats off,5
net.futasaji.keep,Yanic K,perfectly tuned !satisfy all my and my wife needs ! deserve a 5 stars ✨,5
net.futasaji.keep,Luis Romero,Amazing for me and my woman to keep communications clear,5

net.futasaji.keep,omar anter,good app,5
net.futasaji.keep,Matteo Altiero Dastoli,super for now,5
net.futasaji.keep,Wandering Mobi,"Has great potential, but could use some tuning. Needs the ability to add images to tasks/notes. Notification of modification/note added.",3
net.futasaji.keep,Sue G,I like the simple list making but it's supposed to be a shareable list however I don't see how to share it.,4
net.futasaji.keep,John Ryan,a note section would be good,5
net.futasaji.keep,Mohamed eldeeb,simply perfect,5
