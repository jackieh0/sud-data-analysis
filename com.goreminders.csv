com.goreminders,Gary Doube,You reply a year late and claim private info is required for the app to work! NO IT'S NOT REQUIRED. YOU'RE SCAMMING PRIVATE INFORMATION. ------ App won't do anything unless you give them personal information. I'm not that stoopid. Find somebody else to con for personal info... Uninstalled... bye-bye...,1

Easy to sync with calendars, automatic text reminders make life easier, and ability to text clients through the app means I don't have to give out my personnel number.

com.goreminders,Renada Simpson,"I looked and looked for the ""perfect"" app and just couldn't find one. I was so grateful when I ran across this one. It's literally how I function. I have no complains about the layout. The price did increase but it's still affordable. The only thing I would like to change is being able to cancel or edit an appt far out.",5
com.goreminders,MachineGun Shaylee,A year in..It's very useful and needed. However falls short in so many ways. I am looking forward to this being more developed. It lags all the time like dialup just to open things. It doesn't update my calendar when my assistant enters things on her end. It should have a way to see the month calendar at a glance and not have to push every day. It should have ability to have different colors for different kinds of services for that day and have personal time. Ability to link to a calendar.,3

I don't have my staff's time being wasted or wasted gas. I have been using this program for awhile and it keeps getting better. I had been looking for years for something like this and now I have it. If you are a small business owner, I highly recommend this. It is an asset to your business.",5

com.goreminders,Joanna Turner,Go reminders customer service is exceptional. Any time you need to speak to a real human they are so quick to respond and so friendly and efficient. The app is brilliant - I trialled around 10 others before commiting to a package with them; for me it is by far the most user friendly - intuitive and easy to navigate. It does exactly what I want and flawlessly syncs with my google calendar. I was even able to import my client list from invoice2go following their instructions.,5

com.goreminders,A Google user,Very easy to use!,5
com.goreminders,A Google user,Have to spend money to do anything. And get tons of emails! The CHEAPEST monthly plan is $15 a month or $10 a month if you pay for a year. But you get 20 appointment! So not worth it!  Edit to the developer......... I found another app that does all your app does and more but their BASIC plan is FREE and the step up is $9.99 a month or $100 for a year and they were 100% upfront about cost and I don't get tons of emails.  It is UNPROFESSIONAL to ask me to change my rating of your product just because you don't like it. Even though I am being 100% honest in my review! you wanted me to edit it. I did!,1
com.goreminders,A Google user,Very smoothe product,5
com.goreminders,A Google user,Super easy to use. Directly connected to your calender.  Custom make your own professional reminders. Only Flaw...can't take the time slot off your client's reminders. Not all businesses need exact appointment time slots. Wish they would give businesses the option to take that off.,4
